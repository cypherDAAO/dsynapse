## A Decentralized Infrastructure for Open Source LLMs in Web3

### Executive Summary

dsynapse is a decentralized application (dApp) that revolutionizes the way open source large language models (LLMs) are distributed, verified, and utilized. Through the implementation of an incentive system based on tokenomics, dsynapse ensures fair rewards for verifiers and intellectual property owners who contribute to a shared public good, while maintaining the principles of digital sovereignty and accessibility.

### Introduction: Transforming AI with Web3

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and Web3 technologies has led to a new frontier in AI implementation: decentralized Large Language Models (LLMs). These models promise to overcome traditional limitations of AI, including centralization, data silos, and lack of transparency. A decentralized AI ecosystem, leveraging blockchain for trust and IPFS for storage, ensures greater collaboration, innovation, and fairness in access to AI advancements.

### Vision: Decentralized AI Ecosystem

1. **Decentralization**: Eliminate central points of control in AI development and deployment, fostering innovation and resilience against failures.
2. **Blockchain and IPFS**: Use Ethereum for trust and computation; IPFS for efficient storage of AI artifacts (datasets, model weights).
3. **Digital Sovereignty**: Ensure users maintain complete control over their data and interactions.
4. **Local-First Approach**: Prioritize local processing to maximize privacy and performance.

### Cryptoeconomics and Tokenomics

Tokenomics provides the framework for economic operations, using digital tokens to facilitate participation in the ecosystem and alignment of incentives:

- **Utility Token**: Used to access features, rate datasets, and participate in governance.
- **Governance Token**: Facilitates DAO governance structures, ensuring ecosystem developments align with community interests.
- **Incentives**: Rewarding contributions and ratings to promote high-quality AI assets.
- **Ultrasound Money Model**: Deflationary system with burning mechanisms that maintains long-term value.
- **DAO Vault**: 3% of minting in each epoch allocated to software development, community, and other initiatives.

### Fundamental Components of the Ecosystem

#### 1. IPFS/Helia for Data and Model Storage

IPFS ensures decentralized and efficient data storage:
- Each dataset/model is identified by a unique Content Identifier (CID) for integrity and tracking.
- Ethereum smart contracts store essential metadata and manage token interactions linked to these assets.
- Each browser functions as a node that shares LLMs, datasets, and the website, increasing data availability with each connected device.

#### 2. Ethereum Layer for Trust and Transactions

Ethereum smart contracts provide the computational layer, managing:
- Issuance and burning of tokens linked to asset verification.
- DAO governance mechanics for ecosystem decisions.
- Security based on the Proof of Stake consensus model.

#### 3. Integration of DeFi Principles

Incorporating key elements of Decentralized Finance (DeFi):
- **Staking**: Required for governance participation, aligning incentives and security.
- **Burning Mechanism**: Incentivizes honest ratings by imposing a token cost for rating actions.

#### 4. WebGPU for Browser-Based Model Execution

- Open source LLMs run directly in web browsers thanks to WebGPU.
- Eliminates the need for centralized infrastructure for model inference.
- Ensures privacy and complete user control over AI processing.

### Use Cases for Decentralized LLMs

- **Model Sharing and Collaboration**: Open marketplaces for models and datasets backed by trustless verification.
- **Incentivized Data Curation**: Users are rewarded for providing high-quality datasets and accurate model ratings.
- **Governance Participation**: DAO mechanisms enable community-driven protocol updates and adjustments.
- **GameFi and Distributed Rendering**: WASM/GPU-intensive infrastructure provides capabilities for future development in gaming and streaming without centralized systems.

### Mathematical Framework

#### Key Variables and Parameters

- **S(t)**: Total token supply at time t.
- **I(t)**: Token emission rate.
- **B(t)**: Token burning rate.
- **Rj(t)**: Rating score for dataset/model j at time t.
- **Ik(t)**: Emission amount for verified contributions.
- **Itail**: Constant tail emission.
- **γ**: Feedback parameter that impacts emission based on ratings.
- **η, δ**: Parameters managing token burning efficiency and rating decay.

#### Equation Summary

1. **Token Supply Dynamics**:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = I(t) - B(t)$$

Where:
- $$I(t) = \sum Ik(t) + Itail$$
- $$B(t) = \sum \beta \times RateAction_j$$

2. **Rating Feedback and Emission**:

$$\frac{dR_j}{dt} = \eta \times B_j(t) - \delta \times R_j(t)$$

Where:
- $$Ik(t) = V_k \times (Rewardbase + \gamma \times Rrelated(k, t))$$
- $$B_j(t) \propto \text{rating actions}$$

#### Stability Conditions

- To maintain a deflationary supply ("ultrasound"), ensure $$B(t) > I(t) + Itail$$.
- Manage γ, η, δ to balance incentives and effectively regulate supply.

### Governance and Implementation

#### DAO Structure

- **Hybrid Governance System**: Combines token staking and reputation-based mechanisms for decision-making.
- **Parameter Adjustments**: The DAO governs key tokenomic parameters, ensuring adaptability.
- **Security Audits**: Secure coding practices and multiple audits to prevent common vulnerabilities.

#### Security Considerations

- Mitigate governance attacks (e.g., 51% attacks, bribery) through diversified voting power and reputation systems.
- Establish secure storage with IPFS and potentially extend with service incentives like Filecoin.

### Technical Architecture

dsynapse's infrastructure incorporates cutting-edge technologies:

1. **Web3 Base**: Fundamental for the system's decentralization and autonomy.
2. **libp2p/IPFS Helia**: Distributed storage system that enables data sharing between nodes.
3. **WebGPU**: Technology that allows complex LLMs to execute directly in the user's browser.
4. **Smart Contracts**: Implemented on the Ethereum blockchain to manage:
   - Dataset security
   - Governance mechanisms
   - Ultrasound tokenomic ecosystem
5. **WASM/GPU**: Capabilities for future development in intensive applications like GameFi and rendering without dependence on centralized infrastructure.
